# Brejon Ideas
1. Calculator (boring and easy)
2. Music Player (challenging API and unoriginal)
3. Social media scroller (unoriginal, boring, where do we get the data from?)
4. Tic Tac Toe with music in the background (originalish and requires API calls that are not vital to the functionality of the app)

## Evaluation
### **Music Streaming**
* Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
User want to listen to music without needing to wait for web pages. Loading it directly through an app is a benefit.
* Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
* Though music streaming has a big market, plenty of apps do it better. Spotify, soundcloud, youtube music, etc. Despite this, peers who know we created the app would give it a try.
* How large or unique is the market for this app?
Music streaming has an enormous market, but it's not very unique as the core functionalities are the same amongst different platforms. Our audience would be music listeners
* Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
An average user would use this app often, and most commonly only consume music.
* Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
This app is simple to build assuming there is a ready API for music streaming. A stripped down version of a music streaming app is interesting to build in our opinion. This is a well defined app.

### **Social Media Scroller**
* Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
Not unique at all
* Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
If there were no other social medias, this would be a revolutionary idea, but there are plenty. There is little reason to make this one.
* Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
There is a very large and saturated market for social media. This app could be catered towards everyone.
* Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
A unique feature of the app could be limiting post a day. That way users feel like each post should count. Then we need to ask, "Why not use another platform?"
* Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
This idea would simply scrap web data from other media apps and display it. Unoriginal and uninspiring idea overall

### **Tic Tac Toe and Checkers game with background music**
* Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
Playing games on the go is common during trips or in places with a lack of internet service.
* Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
This is a valuable app to people who want to relax with a friend and play games.
* Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
The gaming market is vast, but the board game market is much smaller. This app is for board-game lovers- young and old.
* Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
This app isn't very addicting. It's for the occasional game of tic tac toe or checkers. 
* Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
This app has a moderate difficulty in coding. It requires all the knowledge we have learnt up until this point. A stripped-down version of this app is very interesting to build.
